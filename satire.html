<p>	Growing up in the town of Ivy, I consider Ivy University as my second home. Having spent every Saturday afternoon on its tree-shaded quad, I feel a strong sense of belonging when I observe the diversity of the student body here. As a girl with unusual race, sexual orientation, and religion, I am always the target of discrimination. At Ivy, however, I no longer need to be ashamed of my background; instead, I could further contribute to this amazing diversity. Even though I look completely Asian, I am actually 5% Jamaican, 3.5% Egyptian, 2% Jewish, 1% Scandinavian, and maybe 0.5% Cherokee. Although my classmates often make fun of my Native American heritage, I regard it as an essential part of my identity. My unique sexual orientation also shapes me into who I am today. In addition to being bisexual, I have a fascination with trees, whose luscious leaves never fail to intrigue me. Rather than a hypocritical nature-lover, I am willing to devote my life to the sustainable development of this planet. Aiming to restore the balance between humans and the nature, I joined the Church of Euthanasia five years ago. I believe it is time to stand up against procreate activists and practice sodomy, abortion, cannibalism, and suicide in order to save the planet. Undoubtedly, the liberal atmosphere of Ivy University will not prevent me from killing myself or encouraging my peers to do the same.</p>
<p>	Besides being a part of the diverse student body, I look forward to engaging in as many extracurricular activities as possible to take advantage of the 566 clubs and organizations Ivy has. While many universities boast about the variety of their student clubs, few are capable of claiming that their students join these clubs out of genuine interest. On the other hand, I believe Ivy students are motivated by their passion and not résumé building. After browsing through the descriptions of Ivy’s student clubs and organizations, I am particularly keen to join the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, the Senior Classical League, the National Forensic League, the Phi Alpha Theta Honor Society, the Student Government Association, the Volunteer Association, the Peer Mentoring programs, and the National Honor Society. Just as I appreciate the variety of clubs at Ivy, I also value the ease of starting new ones because I want to continue running a club which I founded in high school. After gaining some leadership experience as the head of the Math Club, the Sustainability Board, and the Ginger Beer Society, I started the Social Observation Club two years ago to raise students’ communal awareness. During our meetings, we log on to non-members’ Facebook accounts to analyze their posts and message their friends, so we can get a sense of how our peers conduct themselves in private. Sometimes we also go on people-watching field trips, during which we use binoculars to observe couples at a safe distance. Offering first-hand guidance on how to kiss, make out, and break up, these trips help teenagers excel in their social lives. I hope to bring this club to the Ivy campus to benefit more students. This same love for community prompts me to participate extensively in community service, which many Ivy students are equally passionate about. In the past four years, I have run a hundred miles for chimpanzees in Congo, baked six hundred cookies for homeless pets, and plunged into freezing water eight times for people suffering from the human werewolf syndrome. When I see kids with this peculiar disorder howling at their neighbors and struggling to walk with their two hind feet, I promise myself that one day, I would help them return to savannas where they could reunite with their wolf mothers.</p>
<p>	While connecting with the outside world through community service, Ivy students bond with each other and the faculty members through mutual support. I know by reputation that Ivy University prides on its tightly knit community in which students and faculty freely share their knowledge and much more. I am excited to live in co-ed dorms where students of different genders are able to develop intimate relationships. By encouraging students to engage in sexual activities as they see fit, Ivy University eliminates the hypocrisy of other colleges’ strict rules and strengthens students’ support for each other. I learned from a friend currently enrolled in Ivy University that the school seems to allow the same intimate relationships between faculty members and students. Believing that to share is to gain, I agree with the school’s philosophy which inspires students to enhance their academic performance by learning from their professors outside the classroom.</p>
<p>	As much as I value diversity, leadership, and community, I am most enthusiastic about Ivy’s challenging yet rewarding academic curriculum. The packed library at three in the morning demonstrates that Ivy students are serious scholars who hold their studies as their upmost priority. Like them, I firmly believe in the necessity of staying up late for academic advancement despite possible chronic sleep deprivation, memory loss, brain damage, digestive problems, anxiety, panic, irregular heart rhythms, weight gain, poor concentration, bad decision-making, mood swings, high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, depression, and death. As future leaders of our nation, we have to make some sacrifice for the good of all citizens. By giving up a few hours of sleep every day, I have gained some precious time that enables me to attain perfect scores on ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, eight SAT Subject Tests, and fifteen AP tests; learn multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra; and study Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, Russian, Turkish, German, Greek, Latin, Chinese, and Navajo. Determined to achieve academic excellence in many fields, I would definitely fit in Ivy’s stimulating environment.</p>
<p>	Most Ivy students, however, go beyond their academic achievements and strive for equal athletic and artistic excellence. Holding myself to the same standard, I captain three varsity sports teams, compete in national and international squash tournaments, play the first-violin in New York Youth Symphony, dance for the New York City Ballet, and organize my own annual art exhibitions. I would never forget the victory of my soccer team in the state championship. Although I was severely injured when competing for the ball with a girl on the opponent team, I stayed on court for the entire game and scored a decisive goal in the last five minutes. If I have the honor to join Ivy’s varsity soccer team, I would certainly bring this level of commitment and team spirit to the group. Whereas participating in sports refines my teamwork skills, engaging in artistic endeavors promotes my ability to think creatively. In a New Year concert at the Carnegie Hall, one of my violin strings broke during my solo. Reacting quickly to the emergency, I cut another three strings in front of the audience and resumed my piece on a single string. Just as Ivy University pushes its students to their full potential, I challenge myself to think outside the box and act beyond my comfort zone.</p>
<p>	Already feeling like home at Ivy University of Ultimate Perfection, I cannot wait to spend the next four years at this remarkable place, sharing my experience with peers and faculty, participating in extracurricular activities, and cheering proudly at athletic games: Go Big Green!
