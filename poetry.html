    <h1>How I Learned English</h1>
    <p>Another Japanese cannonball bombarded <i>Li</i>&rsquo;s ship.<br>
&ldquo;For China!&rdquo; He directed the bow straightforward<br>
and threw himself into the fire. He knew this time<br>
he would not be able to see the victory. Overwhelming heat<br>
struck him. He was sinking, trying to piece together<br>
escaping memories of mother, of China, of New England,<br>
of Margaret, Margaret....
</p>
    <p>I was taught the twenty-six alphabets when I was seven.<br>
They were in strange bubbly shapes. I could not<br>
distinguish the sound of &ldquo;m&rdquo; and &ldquo;n.&rdquo; My pronunciation<br>
was corrected by a teacher with a strong mandarin accent herself.<br>
She called me Shirley, just to rhyme a sloppy homophony<br>
with my Chinese name. And for the longest time,<br>
I avoided saying it&mdash;I could not roll my tongue to enunciate the &ldquo;r.&rdquo;
</p>
    <p>For <i>Li</i>, Margret was the first and only person<br>
to use the word &ldquo;love&rdquo; outside the context of patriotism.<br>
She wrote him letters every month when he was at Harvard,<br>
studying about boats and waters. His Chinese advisor cautioned <br>
him that white girls were dangerous. He never doubted<br>
that he loved his motherland even in harsh wars. He could not tell<br>
if he loved Margret with her sweetest voice.
</p>
    <p>My first trip to the States was for Phillips Academy Summer Session. <br>
I was dragged to the dance, wearing a borrowed<br>
dress, so short that stores in China would never sell.<br>
My roommate powdered my face with makeup.<br>
I stared into the mirror and a stranger glanced back<br>
with all her stunning charms. &ldquo;You look so pretty!&rdquo;<br>
was the sole thing I heard besides the deafening music that night.
</p>
    <p><i>Li</i> was a competent coxswain, a talent that he had shown<br>
when he was at Andover. He calculated current&rsquo;s speed in calligraphy<br>
on his traditional rice paper. So Harvard crew team<br>
finally defeated Yale after thirty years of loss.<br>
<i>Li</i> considered his long ponytail awkward,<br>
particularly during sports, but he could not cut it&mdash;<br>
an act of humiliation to his brilliant ancestry.
</p>
    <p>I am no different than an American girl. Laughing hysterically,<br>
gossiping naturally, calling everyone baby, sweetie,<br>
darling. I learned how to flirt with guys, how to party<br>
till morn, how to point at a girl&rsquo;s face and yell &ldquo;bitch.&rdquo;<br>
I find myself search for appropriate Chinese words<br>
when talking to mother, and stumble over <br>
idiomatic phrases that I used to know by heart.
</p>
    <p><i>Do not trust western barbarians.</i><br>
His mother&rsquo;s last words still ringed in his ears<br>
as <i>Li</i> stepped onto this savage land called the United States.<br>
The heavenly decree burdened the ten-year-old boy<br>
with the duty to study those barbarians&rsquo; tricks,<br>
for saving the fallen Qing Dynasty from the barbarians&rsquo; hands.<br>
He did not even understand English.
</p>
    <p>He was too yellow for an American boy.
</p>
    <p>I am too white for a Chinese girl.

    <h1>Knitting</h1>
    <p>When I was five, Grandma called me over<br>
to watch her knitting my sweater,<br>
threads crossing over threads<br>
into delicate crochet like the shade pattern<br>
on your lantern. Those starless nights,<br>
we hid in the cave under bed, pulling<br>
out secrets from the dark. You told me about him.
</p>
    <p>It always hurt when you stabbed the fingertip,<br>
accidentally sharp ache in heart, invisible blood<br>
dripping down. Grandma had forgotten the pain.<br>
Callus protected her, but not you&mdash;<br>
thirteen was too old for fairy tales,<br>
too young for daunting truth. You could not<br>
breathe under his lips. I never understood
</p>
    <p>how Grandma managed to draw fine yarns<br>
through the tiny hole on her needle point.<br>
Her bad eyesight barely allowed her<br>
to read newspaper titles. She knitted by feeling<br>
almost exhilaration, as he traced your skin on the back.<br>
Tears wetted your eyes. We stared at the sky<br>
for answer. Try not to mess up
</p>
    <p>the array of knots. Grandma had a designer&rsquo;s gallery<br>
in mind. Her favorite was the Utsukushi wrap<br>
with silky lace. All threads danced into the maze<br>
where no exit could be found. You did not know<br>
what to do. I soaked your tears away with tissue<br>
paper. Faint pink dissolved at the edge of darkness.<br>
I felt a little chilly.

    <h1>Decay</h1>
    <p>As the atomic bomb exploded in Hiroshima<br>
particles blinded little girls&rsquo; eyes<br>
radiation deformed new-born infants<br>
expanding forever till<br>
twenty years later<br>
Japanese still woke up at midnight<br>
daunted by the mushroom cloud
</p>
    <p>So tumor cells eat up her brain<br>
inflated membrane and cytoplasm<br>
malignant growth penetrates blood vessels<br>

    <h1>Father, Can You Hear Me?</h1>
    <p>Chinese children grow to respect<br>
their parents, their country, and their blood.<br>
I must be cursed, not a dragon descent,<br>
only having a cold that was never cured.<br>
&ldquo;Take antibiotics,&rdquo; you have always said.<br>
&ldquo;But I am allergic...&rdquo; Then you would cut<br>
me off, tell me either to obey or<br>
to die. Nine thousand miles away<br>
from you, I drank herbal tea instead,<br>
unable to rest, still scratching the itch-less skin.
</p>
    <p>When I was in primary school, you walked me<br>
home on rainy days, hunchback leading<br>
the way in silent mud. You would not shield<br>
me under your umbrella. You did not laugh at<br>
my jokes. So each step chilled me more,<br>
as the rain soaked into my bones. I had to carry<br>
the backpack myself, feeling my spine<br>
cracked into a curve. Ten years later<br>
in the snow, I went to school alone,<br>
unable to speak, still holding the sound-less breath.
</p>
    <p>When I was in middle school, I wanted to quit piano.<br>
Metronome banged on the keyboard,<br>
never in rhythm with tears and scream.<br>
Even when I won the competition,<br>
you told me, &ldquo;Your waltz sounded<br>
like drilling wood.&rdquo; I refused to drill.<br>
You refused to give me food, shutting me <br>
out of the family&rsquo;s door. A hundred beats<br>
livelier than that song, I performed my full recital,<br>
unable to end, still waiting for the praise-less note.
</p>
    <p>Now I am in high school, you wished you had<br>
known me better. For four years, you left me<br>
one message: Do you love me, my daughter?<br>
Do I love you? Have I ever loved you?<br>
Or has China crushed me into dust? <br>
I tried to reply,<br>
but you hung up on my call last night.

    <h1>The Boy</h1>
    <p>Under the bruised afternoon light, the boy practiced Beethoven sonatas, watching his fingers flex across the keyboard as if he were weaving silk. Five clocks ticked on the wall&mdash;clocks in different time zones, zones in which he did not belong. The wall was the color of dust, the color of ages, the color of rusting memories stroked by his furious chords. He buried daily newspapers beneath music scores and pinned bottled-beer caps up against his piano. He was so sickly beautiful&mdash;beautiful because he was suffering, suffering through the arc of his first love. Never would he love again after he augmented the pain in many diminished scales. The room was just dim enough for him to make himself blind in the world of Beethoven. How he admired those irritating harmonies&mdash;irritation that could never be found in Mozart&rsquo;s minuet, Chopin&rsquo;s ballade, or Schubert&rsquo;s fantasia, fantasies for which he once dreamed of and had now forgotten. All windows were plastered by cement. He refused the touch of sunshine and loathed the smell of air. Between the presto sixteenth notes, he suffocated and curved himself into a high C on the treble clef. In the night, his heart started to hunger&mdash;hunger for the cool breath of innocent girls, girls who resembled the thrill of a new sonata. He sought them in the narrowest streets and shadowed them to the darkest corners, his fingers flexed against their breasts and his body curved under their arcs. When the breath left them still, he would kiss their marble faces and wrap them in white satin dresses, letting their bodies float on water as streams of music. They must have thought that the boy was God, because Satan had been dead for years.</p>

    <h1>1143 Odysseus</h1>
    <p>From the Nemean Lion <br>
to the Harvest Mother Virgo,<br>
I lie on my belly on the mountaintop,<br>
steering my father&rsquo;s Ritchey-Chr&eacute;tien <br>
in the mist of the night, afraid <br>
to breathe or blink my eyes,<br>
watching the asteroid glide <br>
across the vernal equinox and disappear <br>
thirty degrees above the horizon.<br>
Before sunrise, I will calculate <br>
its eccentricity and inclination<br>
with my fingers scratching <br>
Kepler&rsquo;s Second Law in the sand,<br>
the way father did to explain <br>
stellar revolutions, rotations, and processions, <br>
smiling as I mapped out every constellation<br>
before learning the street names in town.<br>
I hope to know when I can spot <br>
the asteroid again, as it drifts<br>
to the other side of the ecliptic,<br>
to the sky over Chankillo,<br>
the Peruvian dessert that he longed to go,<br>
where he was last seen with his binoculars, <br>
Schmidt-Cassegrain, and star charts,<br>
vanishing among thirteen ancient towers<br>
that he believed to be a solar observatory.<br>
Then, like a supernova, he glowed <br>
and sank into darkness.<br>
Perihelion, aphelion, <br>
I suppose he still orbits the Sun,<br>
looking for the closest approach to home,<br>
knowing that in the cosmos,<br>
ten years is just a start.

    <p>「百人斬り競爭」の兩將校の野田毅少尉と向井敏明少尉<br>
Contest to kill 100 people between Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda<br>
&mdash;Title of an article in the Tokyo Daily News, December 13, 1937
</p>
    <p>A hint of Honeycrisp in the cold <br>
of dusk, the young girl’s blood <br>
seeped through the cracks<br>
of the pitch, her basket of apples <br>
scattering around. With a wreath <br>
of wintersweet made by her little sister<br>
and two coins for sesame pancakes <br>
from her father, she was on her way<br>
to her grandmother’s house to share<br>
the first harvest, where a hush<br>
twisted her smile into a scream<br>
too painful to be heard. Before she closed <br>
her eyes or took another breath,<br>
she lost her clutch of the basket’s handle<br>
under the “No Fire Zone” banner<br>
hanging on the gate of St. Paul’s Cathedral.
</p>
	<p>Rubbing her blood off his band,<br>
Second Lieutenant Mukai pulled<br>
the bayonet out from her stomach.<br>
His first mark etched on the tang,<br>
he doffed his patrol cap <br>
to the Emperor in the sky.

    <h1>Red Lanterns on the Eaves</h1>
    <p>When the sorghum turns gold, when the frost covers grass, when the frogs no longer croak, red lanterns are to be hung up on the eaves and a girl of age will be married off.</p>
    <p>She saw her mother receiving guests by the wooden door, her shoes polished, her hunchback straightened, her wrinkles smoothed out. She heard her father chatting with her uncles, his coughs gone, his throat cleared, his voice as brisk as the autumn air. She could not sit. She could not stand. She imagined her fiancé whom she never met. She laid her wedding dress on her wicker chair. She pulled out her wedding shoes from under the bamboo bed. Her fingers traced mother’s embroidering of pink water lilies, half-blooming buds floating on fabric of silk. She rolled up the curtains to look at the backyard pond and saw how there were lotuses no more, only lotus leaves left; how there were ducklings no more, only feathers shed. She wondered if the boy next door would still knock on her window after the twilight fell, if they could still sneak out to dip their toes into the icy pond, if he still remembered his promise to marry her when her hair grew to her waist. So she waited and waited until she saw the red lanterns lit up. Mother was calling her name. Father was calling her name. “Water Lily, Water Lily, the sedan chair has arrived.” She soaked up her tears with her wedding veil. Tonight, she must be pretty. Tonight, she must be a woman.</p>

    <h1>While Walking by Virginia’s Window on a Winter Night—</h1>
    <p>flickering candle flame, white oak smelling dry,<br>
a lost robin’s song idling from afar—<br>
I wondered if she had thought of<br>
the weight of the stones as she snapped<br>
the pencil tip again on the crumbled paper,<br>
stained brown by yesterday’s Robusta,<br>
and the kiss of spring waves<br>
as she watched the smolder of her cigarette <br>
intertwining with the smoke of the candle, <br>
eddying around the locks of her hair<br>
that drooped over her eyes and then, in a sudden <br>
gasp for air, she pulled on the knots in those curls,<br>
the withering inspiration that she loathed,<br>
the aspiration, perspiration, respiration, <br>
the dreaming, the writing, the breathing,<br>
the suffering, and she had suffered<br>
the dying of light, the breaking of night,<br>
the irritation, desperation, suffocation,<br>
the dissolving of leaden circles in the fire.<br>
What a fool she had been, submitting to <br>
the murmur of words, adrift in the hours, <br>
and seeing her shadow come closer <br>
to the window, hearing her blow out the candle,<br>
I found myself in the dark, without a room,<br>
a pencil, or a friend, and I wished she would <br>
roll up the blinds and cry out to me,<br>
so I could smile to her and say,<br>
“Good night, Virginia, good night.”

    <h1>Schizophrenia</h1>
    <p>Monday:</p>
    <p>This is not me. This is my research. <br>
I told someone I just finished my first year at MIT. He asked if I was doing a PhD or master program.<br>
Last time I checked I was getting a BS (Bullshit) degree.<br>
Tried to kill time with Philip Glass and Stravinsky. Ended up printing music scores. <br>
Couldn’t figure out how the printer work and a colleague offered to print the document for me.<br>
No, I was not ready to justify how treble clef and sixteenth notes fit in my genetic algorithm for schizophrenic patients.</p>
	<p>Bought four butter croissants and four chocolate croissants for dinner. Thought I could eat them in one sitting.<br>
I left two for breakfast.<br>
A friend called me and talked about arts. I complained about coding instead.<br>
Maybe you could do some writing during work? She suggested.<br>
I opened a word document on my laptop but opted for watching competitive eating videos.<br>
Sixty-two hot dogs in ten minutes.
</p>
	<p>Tuesday:
</p>
	<p>Painfully reading error messages in French from the R console. <br>Still wondering how to type the OR operator on French keyboard. <br>
The director of the research center greeted me during lunch.<br>
My supervisor told me they wanted me to continue this project after the proposed internship period.<br>
I hadn’t even received the data.
</p>
	<p>My landlord tangoed to my playing on a digital piano.<br>
I love artists, she said.<br>
I’m hungry again. I thought.<br>
Sometimes, I could eat just cocoa products for the entire day: chocolate granola bars, chocolate ice cream, chocolate cereal, chocolate cake–there’s quite a variety.<br>
I attempted to read <i>Persuasion</i> as if it were some sort of erotica.<br>
Then I attempted to read real erotica.<br>
My sexual desires certainly identified more with the melodrama of 18th century.<br>
What’s happening with our generation?
</p>
	<p>Wednesday:
</p>
	<p>I’ve perfected my “Merci, au revoir” for the driver when getting off the bus.<br>
DAG is not just Directed Acyclic Graph, but also diacylglycerol. <br>
Formally, GIRKs are G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels. Phonetically, they are just jerks.<br>
My friends on Facebook were not responding. So I did two-week worth of work in one morning.<br>
I had fried Camembert for lunch and I’d never eat fried Mozzarella sticks again.
</p>
	<p>My parents were using my Facebook posts as their WeChat posts (hello, mom and dad).<br>
I binge-watched Jimmy Fallon for almost three hours.<br>
Replayed Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s lip sync to Superbass five times.<br>
Inspired to learn how to rap Anaconda. Slightly bothered by Nicki Minaj’s butt in the music video.<br>
More bothered by my crush. Another chapter from <i>Persuasion</i>.
</p>
	<p>Thursday:
</p>
	<p><i>Depuis le temps que vous entendiez parler de coup de foudre, ça y est!</i><br>
Horoscopes appear in all the French newspapers I read.<br>
Least-squares means might not count as love at first sight, but they were my companions for the day.<br>
P-value = 0.1823. I supposed our love wasn’t significant after all.
</p>
	<p>Trashy writing is still writing.<br>
I printed more music scores.<br>
This time I learned to cover them up with the results from my statistical analysis.<br>
Don’t worry, nobody has gone crazy. Yet.
</p>
	<p>(Orginally meant for Facebook post)

    <h1>Sex, Drugs, and Other Confessions</h1>
    <p>You're not perfect. You're not beautiful.<br>
If you have too much drama in your life, drink less and do more drugs.<br>
Why would you go to the best school in the world so you can work for fucking tinder?<br>
I need someone who’s LinkedIn on the streets, tinder in the sheets.<br>
My vibrator broke so I guess it's time to get a boyfriend.<br>
</p>
    <p>My boyfriend broke so I guess it's time to get a vibrator.<br>
I wish someone who you really care rejects you.<br>
Any tips on how to be more feminine without being superficial?<br>
Pro-tip: meth makes you productive AND skinny.<br>
I'm sorry for all the drama. I wish we were in love.</p>
	<p>FINALS = Fuck I Never Actually Learned Shit.<br>
Our president just went around the library giving cookies to students.<br>
I matched with my TA on dildo.io.<br>
I fucked my TA in the bathroom<br>
and he gave me the answers to the exams.
</p>
	<p>The closest thing I come to real intelligence is sleeping with smart people.<br>
Dear, Matt Damon. My vagina is ready for pounding.<br>
Move-out day is a social test to see if you made enough friends.<br>
Need help with packing. Will pay with sex. Once per box sound fair?<br>
If there is one thing I miss from MIT it will be the wifi.
</p>
	<p>I'm hopelessly in love with my best friend.<br>
I thought I liked science because I was attracted to scientists.<br>
I want to hit on a guy but I never hear him speak English.<br>
I have pre-midlife crisis.<br>
I stuck a GoPro up my TA's ass.
</p>
	<p>The hottest and smartest girls?<br>
This guy is the most disgusting and desperate person I’ve ever met.<br>
I highly recommend coding while high.<br>
People think I look sick with worries.<br>
Shit. I thought I was special.

    <h1>To the Men Walking By</h1>
    <p>You don’t know my name, but you asked,<br>
“How much a night?”<br>
There isn’t a price for the night.<br>
There isn’t a price for the past nine years of my life.<br>
You only saw the ripped jeans, the plaid shirt, and the messy bun;<br>
you didn’t see there are things you couldn’t strip away.
</p>
    <p>A boy promised to marry me in kindergarten<br>
with a ring of leaves from evergreen shrub.<br>
I ran away to the other side of the playground<br>
because I didn’t want to wear a lacy wedding dress.<br>
I feel sorry now and I would apologize<br>
if he still remembers what he had once promised.
</p>
	<p>You called me sexy. You called me hot.<br>
You joked with your friends about taking my leggings off.<br>
I never said a word and kept my head down,<br>
sometimes thinking about circuits, sometimes determinism.<br>
Of course, you wouldn’t care. <br>
You wanted it to be simple. You wanted to fuck.
</p>
	<p>One day I decided I had to be skinnier;<br>
then I started binging and purging;<br>
then insomnia, depression, and anxiety.<br>
My mother said I was a schizophrenic freak.<br>
I told her mild mania increases creativity.<br>
I continued to write, to hack, to make. I continued to create.
</p>
	<p>You followed me down the street at two a.m.<br>
You made me drink hard liquor. I’d hardly touched beer.<br>
I coughed because of the sawdust in the machine shop.<br>
My fingers bled because I sanded plastic for hours long.<br>
I was too tired to wash spray paint off my hands<br>
or to explain to you I wasn’t a stripper. I’m an engineer.
</p>
	<p>Yesterday I passed by a little boy and his mother.<br>
He asked her who I was. The mother replied,<br>
“She is a beautiful girl.”<br>
I don’t know his name, but I hope<br>
he will remember that he didn’t walk by a prostitute.<br>
He walked by a soul, however beaten or broken, still beautiful.
