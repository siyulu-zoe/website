Our schedules can sometimes feel a little overwhelming. Between the long work hours, busy social calendars and the balancing act of relationships, it’s not always easy to find the time to make it into the gym. The key is to find a go-to workout you can do from anywhere, just in case your day does not permit a gym visit. This will help keep you fit from anywhere. You can always count on feeling and looking your best, no matter the circumstance.

My job takes me on the road, and I do not always have the time or energy to find a local gym. This summer I was working every weekend in LA or New York. In order to keep myself from gaining the road weight, I had to make sure I fit in at least 30 minutes of exercise everyday. This workout routine helped to keep me energized throughout the day, strengthened and toned my legs and made me feel much better about myself when I got back to town. It also curbed my cravings and helped me make better food choices. I fit in my share of delectable delights but overall it was much easier to eat healthy foods after this workout.

Perform the routine three times per week. Once you have finished the entire workout, repeat the entire routine two more times. No equipment required!
