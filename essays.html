    <h1>When Milton Considers How His Light Is Spent</h1>
    
    <p>“And God said, Let there be light: and there was light” (Genesis 1:3). Ever since the creation of this matter, humans have woken up to natural light, invented artificial light, and sought spiritual light. Literally and figuratively, light guides our way. In his epic <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton asks his Muse to “illumine” (1.22) him so that light can direct his arguments. This light not only helps him “justify the ways of God” (1.126), but also allows him to embark on a more personal journey, in which he reflects on his own being through his relationship with light. Despite his many references to light, Milton never clearly defines this natural agent. Thus, we may only infer what light means to him by analyzing his verses and considering his background. Together, the text of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Milton’s blindness, and his religious belief suggest that Miltonic light embodies spiritual goodness, a vision beyond mortal sight, and salvation by inner grace.</p>
    <p>Before answering the question of what light is, the poem tries to clarify where light comes from. Describing light as the “offspring of Heav’n firstborn” (3.1), the invocation in Book 3 begins by stating that light is God’s first creation. Uncertain of this explanation, the narrator offers another possibility that light is the “Eternal coeternal beam” (3.2), a substance independent of God. Then, he equates God with light, implying that light is neither a creation of nor a coexistence with God; rather, light and God are interchangeable. This assumption is again replaced by the claim that God dwells in light, which suggests that light precedes God, who appears as the “Bright effluence of bright essence increate” (3.6).</p>
    <p>The ambiguity in the origin of light further mystifies this intangible matter, rendering its meaning more fascinating to readers. Whether God has created light or light has created God or they have come into being together, the strong association between God and light indicates that Miltonic light denotes spiritual goodness. Indeed, the narrator often employs brightness as a physical representation of a character’s virtue. The perfectly noble God, therefore, is surrounded by such “glorious brightness” (3.376) that He becomes “invisible” (3.375). The angels of Heaven, “[standing] thick as stars” (3.61), are also very bright beings. Although Satan used to be Lucifer the Light-bringer “clothed with transcendent brightness” (1.86), he gradually loses his “original brightness” (1.591), retaining only a hint of “false glitter” (10.452). </p>
    <p>However, brightness alone is not sufficient to separate good from evil. Similar to light, fire is also bright. Yet, while light epitomizes God and Heaven, fire is associated with devils and Hell. The key difference between light and fire lies in their tangibility. Making humans “set and rise” (4.664) with light, God, like a “bright officious [lamp]” (9.105), exerts an intangible and spiritual control on humans. Following God by faith, His worshippers do not need to see Him or obtain proofs of His authority to believe in Him. When the devils attempt to “imitate” this kind of “[God’s] light” (2.269-270), they only manage to recreate its brightness through “tempestuous fire” (1.77), but they cannot capture light’s divinity because fire is tangible and corporeal. Not surprisingly, this flaming substance, with its connotation of bodily pain, characterizes Hell. That Satan has to make himself visible to Eve in the form of a serpent and that he has to present lengthy arguments to trick her into eating the apple illustrate that Satan’s manipulation of humans differs from God’s spiritual control. Had Eve not seen the serpent and its physical proof of power, which is the apple from the Tree of Knowledge, Satan would not have been able to tempt her. </p>
    <p>Unfortunately, the devil’s “contagious fire” (9.1036) has succeeded in infecting our first two parents. After Adam and Eve eat the apple, both of them experience immeasurable “delight” (9.787 and 9.1023). With the prefix “de-“ expressing “removal,” the word “delight” conveys a sense of losing light, hinting at the Fall of Man. The etymology of this word supports such interpretation. Coming from Latin <i>delectare</i> “to allure,” the word “delight” suggests temptation and is thus closely related to Satan the Tempter. Because Satan is God’s greatest foe, the delight offered by him becomes the opposite of the light given by God. Aiming to corrupt humans, Satan’s actions to “delight” Adam and Eve essentially strip them of their spiritual goodness.</p>
    <p>To regain his virtuousness, the narrator invokes his Muse, asking the Holy Spirit to “Illumine” “what in [him] is dark” (1.22-23). This darkness not only refers to the baseness of human nature, but also alludes to Milton’s blindness, making light more personal to Milton. By asking the Muse to illuminate him, Milton reveals that he wants a vision. Rather than a recovery from his blindness, his desired vision is the ability to “see and tell / Of things invisible to mortal sight” (3.54-55). This special vision allows him to perceive the disguise of the fallen angels while others, like the peasant charmed by the dancing elves, fail to realize the danger of being enticed by evils. He hopes that his vision beyond mortal sight will equate him with “Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, / And Tiresias and Phineus” (3.35-36), bringing him as much “renown” (3.34) as these poets and prophets have attained. Transitioning from an account of his own aspiration, Milton continues to use sight-related words to describe God, highlighting how God “[bends] down his eye,” “[views]” “His own works,” “[receives] / Beatitude” “from his sight,” and [beholds] / (humans’) two first parents” (3.58-65). The implicit comparison between Milton’s vision and God’s vision further suggests that the light from heavenly Muse gives Milton a divine and perceptive sight, superior to that of the worldly and undiscriminating mortals.</p>
    <p>When invoking his Muse, Milton claims that the “celestial Light / [shines] inward, and the mind through all her powers / Irradiate” (3.51-53). Such notion that God’s light shines into humans’ souls reminds readers of the Christian belief that salvation is achieved through inner grace, adding another layer of meaning to Miltonic light. Although God “[sits] / Throned inaccessible” (3.376-377), man still have access to His light. God has not abandoned humans because He allows them to “[escape]” their damnation in “the Stygian pool” (3.14) and “revisit” (3.13) their salvation in light. Responding to the Son’s fear that Satan will corrupt men completely, the Father reaffirms that “[men] shall not quite be lost, but saved” (3.173) “for [He] will clear their senses dark” (3.188). According to the Father, men will be able to achieve both spiritual goodness and ultimate salvation by acquiring light. The process of “[reascending]” (3.20) from darkness is “hard and rare” (3.21), but the Father’s speech gives men hope because He promises to “place within them a guide / [His] umpire conscience, whom if they will hear, / Light after light well used they shall attain” (3.194-196). Therefore, if humans follow the guidance of their inner light in the right way, they will receive more and more light until they “arrive [at Heaven]” (3.197); on the other hand, those who choose not to follow the light of conscience “shall never taste” (3.199) salvation, “But hard be hardened, blind be blinded more” (3.200). </p>
    <p>The choice between following the light and neglecting it evokes the central theme that men are both free to be saved and free to fall, corresponding to the statement that “The mind is its own place, and in itself / Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n” (1.254-255). In his final words to Adam before Adam and Eve’s departure from Eden, Michael emphasizes the importance of making the right choice by instructing Adam to “add faith, …virtue, patience, temperance, …(and) love” (12.583-583) to his knowledge so that he can “possess / A paradise within [him]” (12.586-587). Michael’s assertion that Adam will be happier by possessing an inner paradise than by physically living in Eden further illustrates that the attainment of light or salvation is not so much related to men’s surroundings as to their consciences. With inner grace, men can be saved wherever they are.</p>
    <p>This connection between light and salvation by grace echoes Milton’s conclusion of his sonnet “When I Consider How My Light Is Spent.” Worried that blindness will prevent him from serving God, he finally realizes that “God doth not need / Either man’s work or his own gifts” (9-10); in fact, standing by and waiting on God is enough for His satisfaction. In this way, the sonnet confirms that humans can be accepted and saved by God no matter what their physical conditions are. Because “celestial Light” (3.51) can “irradiate” (3.55) the sighted and the sightless alike, God installs grace in whoever chooses to follow His light. Although Milton starts by considering how his physical light is extinguished, he seems to conclude that his real light is not extinguished after all. Since his blindness does not preclude him from achieving spiritual goodness, a vision beyond mortal sight, or salvation by inner grace, he is free to approach light even when light does not come to him. Just like Milton, nothing hinders us from pursuing light in times of difficulty. When facing exterior darkness, we can retain our inner light to keep us from corruption. By becoming our own source of illumination, we will never have our light spent. </p>

    <h1>Are We Saved?</h1>
    
    <p>“And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works” (Revelation 20:12, King James Bible). By setting sin and salvation as two fixed opposites, the Christian faith claims that on the Judgment Day, the sinners are “cast into the lake of fire” (Revelation 20:15, King James Bible) while those who are saved will enjoy immortality and unending happiness. Drawing on the themes of sin and redemption, Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> hones in these prominent Christian beliefs and provides an elaborate yet dissimilar view from that of the Bible and consequently from that of the Puritan society which upheld these Christian values. The highly symbolic character of Pearl epitomizes Hawthorne’s complex attitude toward sin and redemption. As a reminder of sin, a prompt for salvation, and an emblem for resurrection, Pearl parallels both Christ and redemption itself. Different from the Bible, however, <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> does not present salvation and depravity as two separate and irreversible states; instead, it suggests that the boundary between the two can be ambiguous and that sinners have opportunities to actively redeem themselves before the Last Judgment.</p>
    <p>Although the narrator often depicts Pearl as the “elf-child” (74) or the “demon offspring” (68), Pearl does not represent evils. Born from sin, Pearl nevertheless embodies an “innocent life” and an “immortal flower” made by “the inscrutable decree of Providence” (61). By emphasizing Pearl’s innocence, immortality, and her relationship to God, the novel hints at the similarities between Christ and Pearl, both coming to earth under God’s command. The opposition between Pearl and the Black Man, the force of depravity, further suggests that Pearl sides with the force of morality. In her role as a protector, Pearl has saved her mother several times from “Satan’s snare” (80) by preventing Hester from engaging in witchcraft. Believing that the Black Man cannot catch her, Pearl is rendered beyond the control of evilness. Indeed, despite the prevalence of physical darkness in the novel, the presence of Pearl usually couples with the appearance of light and sunshine, which are also associated with Christ and redemption. In this way, the novel primarily establishes Pearl as a positive influence.</p>
    <p>Following this interpretation, we may find Pearl’s naughtiness puzzling. Though Pearl does not have Christ’s all-loving character and patience, she uses her mischievous behavior as a reminder of Hester and Dimmesdale’s sin. As “her mother’s only treasure” “purchased with all [Hester] had” (61), Pearl echoes the pearl from a biblical parable, in which “the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls: Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it” (Matthew 13:45-46, King James Bible). While the popular reading equates the merchant man with the sinner and the pearl with Christ, a lesser common reading parallels the merchant man with Christ and the pearl with salvation for all mankind. The role of Pearl in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i> matches both interpretations of the pearl in the parable. As a Christ-like figure, Pearl constantly reminds Hester and Dimmesdale of their wrongdoings and prompts them to redeem. Often carrying a “mocking smile” (63), Pearl evokes a poignant sense of guilt within the hearts of sinners. Tortured by this smile, Hester wonders whether Pearl is her punishment, crying, “Child, what art thou” (67). Rather than responding with “I am your daughter,” Pearl answers, “I am your little Pearl” (67). This response implies that although Pearl is torturing her mother at the moment, her can ultimately save Hester and fulfills the function as “the pearl of great price.” When Hester further questions about “who sent [her child] hither” (67), Pearl insists that Hester answer this question herself. Just like Christ seeks to make humans realize their own sins, Pearl encourages Hester to face her own immoralities and then redeem them. Pearl also laughs at Dimmesdale when he refuses to stand with her and Hester on the scaffold in the daylight and she laughs again when he promises to stand with them “at the great judgment day” (105). Her laughs not only point to the hypocrisy and cowardice of the minister, but also suggest her disbelief in the Judgment Day. Not understanding what the Judgment Day is, Pearl wants Dimmesdale to stand with her sooner in his lifetime rather than later. Through Pearl, the novel hints at the possibility of self-redemption before the Last Judgment, which makes the recognition of one’s sin even more urgent. The repetition of Pearl’s questions “What does the letter mean, mother?&mdash;and why dost thou wear it?&mdash;and why does the minister keep his hand over his heart?” (124) reinforces Pearl’s function both as a reminder of sin and as a prompt for salvation. Her constant queries and her mocking smile pressure Hester and Dimmesdale to fully understand the gravity of their sin and seek atonement.</p>
    <p>Interestingly, Hester and Dimmesdale cannot perceive Pearl as a real child before their redemption. On a more metaphorical level, salvation is intangible for sinners who have not grasped the severity of their immoralities. After Hester rids herself of the scarlet letter and her hat, she has fallen back to sin and is thus “estranged” (142) from salvation, represented by Pearl. By staring at Hester and Dimmesdale and “pointing [her] small forefingers at Hester’s bosom” (144), Pearl demands her parents not to forget their sin. Only when Hester refastens the scarlet letter and gathers “the heavy tresses of her hair” (145) does the child reaffirm that she is her mother’s little Pearl; in other words, Hester regains her hope to be saved. However, since Dimmesdale still refuses to publicly recognize Pearl as his daughter, he receives “no favor” (146) from her. In fact, Pearl needs to “[bathe] her forehead (in the sunshine)…[to wash] off” (146) the minister’s sinful kiss. Accordingly, Dimmesdale will not be welcomed by salvation until he exposes his sin and repents with his life.</p>
    <p>The torment Pearl inflicts on Hester and Dimmesdale reveals that redemption is not an easy process: sinners have to sacrifice certain things that are dear to them in order to achieve the even dearer salvation. Dimmesdale chooses to give up his reputation and die a death of “triumphant ignominy” (176). This seemingly paradoxical phrase illuminates that he has “won the victory” (175) in his internal moral combat by publicly shaming himself. When “Pearl [kisses] his lips” (175), Dimmesdale attains his “pearl of great price.” With the death of the recipient of Hester’s passion and feminineness, Hester subsequently forgoes these two qualities for her redemption. Therefore, “Pearl’s errand as a messenger (towards her mother) [is] fulfilled” as well (175). As Dimmesdale and Hester are saved from their sin, Pearl becomes a “human” (175) child, tangible to her parents. Since the book does not specify whose “spell [is] broken” (175), we may infer that the spell used to bind not just Pearl, but also Hester and Dimmesdale. In this way, the broken spell refers both to the growing sympathies in Pearl and God’s gift of salvation to her parents.</p>
    <p>As Pearl develops her understanding of “human joy and sorrow” (175), she also becomes a symbol of resurrection for both Dimmesdale and Hester. The reputation forsaken by Dimmesdale and the womanhood forsaken by Hester are reborn in Pearl: she does not repeat the sin committed by her parents and enjoys the “flush and bloom” (179) of feminineness. Even “the gossips of that day” (179) believe that Pearl lead a “happy” (179) life that her parents cannot have. Through Pearl, the novel affirms that sinners can actively redeem themselves instead of passively waiting for God’s judgment. Born out of sin yet eventually transforming into the fruit of salvation, the character of Pearl indicates that the conversion from sin to salvation is possible. That Hester becomes other people’s counselor further suggests that such conversion stimulates personal growth. With her journey from sin to redemption, Hester gains personal strength, learns sympathy, and increases her general understanding of human conditions. Just as Adam and Eve receive knowledge from their fall, Hester acquires “a new truth” (180) about “the whole relation between man and woman” (180) from her depravity. </p>
    <p>Thus, sin can almost be seen as a necessity for redemption because individuals and society cannot improve unless they have faults in the first place. By reconciling sin with personal and societal growth, the novel blurs the line between morality and immorality. Such ambiguity is evident in the arrangement of Hester’s and Dimmesdale’s graves and the inscription on their shared tombstone: has the society upheld its moral standards by separating their graves? Or has it accepted their love to some degree by burying them under one tombstone? Has the “sable”  (180) field stifled the passion of the “scarlet” (180) letter? Or has the scarlet letter stained the purity of the sable field? With the final image of the scarlet A in mind, we may still be unsure about how we view Hester’s life. We know she is the adulteress, yet we can empathize with her because we have our own “hidden sin” (59) and experience similar struggles as Hester does. While we ponder over her story, perhaps a more important question that we need to think about is where we stand between depravity and salvation: can we redeem ourselves before the Judgment Day?</p>

    <h1>Scarecrows in Disguise</h1>
    
    <p>I’m always terrified when people tell me to just be myself. I know I can be labeled as a student, a daughter, and a friend, but I don’t know who I am. Although I was uneasy about this identity crisis at first, I gradually realized that when people say, “Be yourself,” they really mean, “Be a girl with style.” Surely, when colleges tell us to let our personalities shine through, we are supposed to talk about how hardworking we are as students, how attentive we are as family members, and how generous we are as friends. In other words, we are supposed to put on a good show, though the show may be based on reality. After all, colleges only have time to look at our “rat’s coats, crowskin, and crossed staves” (Eliot, “The Hollow Men”). They judge applicants by their styles, not substances. This focus on what’s outside instead of what’s inside doesn’t grow out of thin air. From the London upper class in Oscar Wilde’s <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> to the Congo natives in Joseph Conrad’s <i>Heart of Darkness</i>, people admire the hollow men, as long as they have their styles.</p>
    <p>In Wilde’s Victorian world, Cecily and Gwendolen both fall in love with a man named Earnest. Earnest can’t have any substance; in fact, Earnest isn’t even real. As a made-up character, he is appealing because he has a divine name that apparently inspires “absolute confidence” (Wilde, Act I, p. 2230 and Act II, p. 2247). The two girls like the name so much that they pity any woman who doesn’t marry a man called Earnest. After finding out that they’ve been deceived by two gentlemen whose actual names are Jack and Algernon, they take no time to forgive their lovers, pointing out that the Christian names are the only “insuperable barrier” (Wilde, Act III, p. 2255). Cecily and Gwendolen’s comment seems silly, but in truth, Jack and Algernon are no different from Earnest other than their names. One with an invented brother and the other with a fictitious friend, both men lead more or less made-up lives that contain little substance but much style. They are hollow men, just like Earnest. The strategy they use to cover up their hollowness is called “bunbury,” which is hypocrisy at heart, yet full of elegance and even benevolence when performed in the name of love. The two gentlemen’s ready bunburying and the two ladies’ ready acceptance and encouragement of such act completely reduce earnest from a quality of character to a petty name. With its witty and lighthearted tone, <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i> is really about the importance of not being earnest. The ending affirms that while sincerity and seriousness get one nowhere in life, triviality leads to marriage and happiness.</p>
    <p>Similar to Jack and Algernon, Kurtz is a hollow man with flair. Going into Congo with a philanthropic goal, Kurtz sets out to be the man that the society expects him to be, yet he eventually degenerates into an empty core in the wilderness. The wilderness isn’t what causes him to be hollow; rather, it makes his hollowness visible: under the light of civilization, a shadow can attach to social values and morals and take their shapes, but in the uncultivated darkness, a shadow has nothing to depend on, so he loses all his restraints and sense of morality. However, Kurtz’s hollowness doesn’t prevent him from being a remarkable man. His eloquence and grandiosity give the shadow such a style that almost elevates him to godhood. As readers, we know that Kurtz’s great style cannot justify his cruelty, but it’s enough to give him power because the natives, the Intended, the cousin, and even Marlow all choose to focus on what’s outside instead of what’s inside. By being nothing, Kurtz becomes everything—to the natives, he appears as deity; to his Intended, he appears as a humanitarian; to his cousin, he appears as a musician and journalist; to Marlow, he appears as a universal genius. In his dying moment, the hollow man looks inside and sees nothing. “The horror! The horror!” (Conrad, p. 2379) he cries at the “impalpable greyness” (Conrad, p. 2380). Kurtz finally realizes the evils he has done and the evilness he has been, but as the only man to step over the edge, he is the only one that comprehends the horror of hollowness. The other people can do nothing but remain loyal to the shadow he leaves behind. Kurtz’s style lives on and so does his hollowness—the former in people’s memories and the latter in people’s actual beings. In the immense darkness, the time when the general society can look past the superficiality is still far.</p>
    <p>I like to think <i>Heart of Darkness</i> as a novella about self-exploration and I applaud Kurtz’s courage to look inside and judge his own hollowness. Yet like Marlow, I struggle to step over the edge myself. Perhaps our society’s preoccupation with the exterior results exactly from this same fear to pierce into the interior and to confront hollowness. An ostrich facing danger, I bury my head into the sand and attempt to assure myself that with style, a hollow man can be happy and successful. But is it so? Am I content to bunbury through my life? Do I want to become Mr. Kurtz? While I know the answer is no, I also know that the moment I start to search for my substance, I’ll confirm that I’m formless, colorless, and thoughtless. I’ll be defeated. So for now, I cringe into my shadow, projecting the surrounding social labels onto myself. If I can’t beat the hollow men, I’ll join them—with a deliberate disguise.</p>
