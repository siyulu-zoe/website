    <h1>Neverland</h1>
    <p>And she kissed me. A succinct, dry kiss under the water. My heart didn’t have time to beat once before the sweetness ended. I felt as if two tiny wings were growing out just under my shoulders. I closed my eyes, letting the current in the pool drift by my eyelids. When I reopened them, I saw my figure reflected in her champagne-colored eyes. The lights in the pool lit up and the black water around us suddenly turned transparent. Her blond hair sparkled. I imagined if I stared at her eyes long enough, they would become honey and melt into the water. I thought she must be the most beautiful person I had ever met.</p>
    <p>The night was magical like a dream. Perhaps it was&mdash;we never saw each other again.</p>
    <p class="center"><em >*</em></p>
    <p>Peter was sweating too. I counted the sweat beads on his forehead: five, six, seven…</p>
    <p>“Are you sure you want to do it?” His fingers trembling slightly, he held my face in his warm palms.</p>
    <p>“Yes, darling. I am sure.” I took his hands off my face and placed them on my laps. The air was filled with the smell of summer that made me restless, or maybe I was only anxious.</p>
    <p>“You haven’t told me why you wanted to revisit Disney, and why you refused to stay in any other hotel but the Marriott.” He ran his fingers up and down my neck; then he pressed me against his chest. I could feel his breath twining into my braids.</p>
    <p>“I’ve found love here before,” I said, almost tasting honey in my mouth. “This is a special place.”</p>
    <p>How long I had been waiting for this moment! I was nervous, clueless about how to act and what to think, but I wanted Peter to become part of me; I wanted to fit in this world; I wanted to feel less black. When we walked around the campus, I would grasp his hand, so tightly, as if he could have been blown away by the wind. Peter was a pre-med major with scholarship. His parents divorced when he was twelve. Although his father was a lawyer while his mother was a housewife who dropped out of college, his father showed her no pity and refused to give her monthly allowance to pay Peter’s tuition. Peter did not tell me what happened exactly. I assumed it was his father’s fault, yet I dared not to ask him because he seemed to admire this man who abandoned him. He thought his father was clever and handsome, and had every right to leave his mother. She was a gentle woman, but he despised her passive attitude of life – she never looked for jobs and lived upon government’s unemployment benefits. With clear goals in mind, Peter aspired to be a great man, perhaps even greater than his father. After studying at Phillips Academy with financial aid for four years, he came to University of Pennsylvania. Soon, he would become a doctor, and others would envy his look, his intelligence, and his lifestyle.</p>
    <p>I was a lucky black girl to have this boy lying by my side, tracing my collarbones, and unbuttoning my blouse.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>My mother was waiting with me in the preparation room. I zipped and unzipped my wedding gown five times to scratch my back where my invisible pair of wings was. Mother brought the tin box, covered with dust, in which she kept all my childhood memories. She pulled out the butterfly hairpin from the bottom. The hairpin was no longer shiny and the matching necklace had been missing for ages, but it was a treasure and I wouldn’t trade it for diamonds. She carefully clipped it onto my hair and kissed me on the cheek.</p>
    <p>“Take care of yourself,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Don’t worry, mama.” I looked into the mirror one last time to check if my veil was in the right place. My heart was pounding so hard that my breast hurt.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>We had our first family vacation when I was eight. Father could not come with us, so my sister Lisa seized the chance to coax mother and nanny into going to Disney World. Father would not have approved this trip because he believed we had better use of the money; buying a Mickey Mouse headband was clearly not his priority. Lisa understood father’s thought and carefully concealed her yearning until the appropriate time. A week later, we left the house in Dorchester for her dream trip.</p>
    <p>Lisa was so excited that she could not stop singing on the way.</p>
	<p>“Shut up. You are being annoying,” I told her on the airplane.</p>
    <p>She smirked at me and continued her princess’ songs in a dreadful voice. I was better than Lisa in everything, but mother, nanny, and all other people still considered her to be the more adorable one just because of her large enchanting eyes. When we were in kindergarten, I taught her how to ride a bike. She fell and scratched her knee. After noticing the bruise, mother gave me a scornful look as if I was the one who pushed Lisa to the ground. It was those little things that irritated me. No one had to say anything, and I would know&mdash;they liked Lisa more.</p>
    <p>She was in high spirits that day as she got what she wanted, again. The spring break was only ten days long, and I saw no point travelling. I preferred staying home and watching television, but my opinion never counted.</p>
    <p>During the three-hour layover at Atlanta, I decided I should not smile throughout the trip to show my dissatisfaction, not that anyone would care.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>Peter took off my shorts as I un-tucked his shirt. He stood behind me, reaching his hands forward to my breasts. My head turned into a blank piece of paper and I knew I would do anything he asked. He turned on erotic jazz music and danced me around, speaking softly into my ears. Twilight cast a shadow of us onto the immaculate white sheets on the bed; he danced me to the shadow and pressed me down. His tongue tasted a bit sour from the beer. I sank into emptiness and craved for the taste. My heart, lungs, liver, and stomach ceased to function under his weight. I remembered that last Valentine’s Day, he said, “You gave me a cardiac tachycardia.” It meant I made his heart beat too fast. But now, my heart just stopped beating altogether, and I felt as if I were flying like a feather into the unknown region. When he finally entered my body, blood rushed into my heart and it started pumping again. I gasped for air. He held me up against him, so I could feel us fitting together like two pieces of puzzle. With new puzzle pieces, you had to push hard, or else, they would not click into each other at the edge. As we clicked, my head dropped back.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>When we finally got to Orlando, it was eight o’clock at night. Lisa was too tired to talk, and she soon fell asleep, kicking the sheets like a little cat. Mother and nanny were busy planning our trip to Disney the next day. Mother was a very organized woman – she always knew where she was going, even during the most difficult time in her life. She laughed at the years when her drunken father beat her up every other night, when she had to work past midnight to pay her debt of college tuition, and when her husband was waiting for employment and she was the only support for the family. She talked about those stories as if they were not hers. In my entire life, I never saw her shedding a single teardrop.</p>
    <p>After shuffling through all the television channels and finding nothing interesting, I snuck out of the room and wandered around. The Marriott seemed to be a nice hotel with flowers and crystal lamps everywhere. However, as I walked beyond the reception lobby into the hallways, I noticed how the pale yellow wallpaper made this place look the same as all other hotels. I took three left turns and two rights turns and found myself lost in the uniformity of the hotel. Unfortunately, I did not keep track of my lefts and rights, nor did I recall our room number. Trying to listen for my mother’s voice, I stuck my ear against every cold, wooden door, but all I heard was the sound of my own breath.</p>
    <p>If I was already lost and couldn’t find my way back, why didn’t I just get more lost? I opened a door leading to the staircase and played the pirate game in my head as I walked up and down the stairs. I was always Peter Pan, and if Lisa were in the game, she would be Tinker Bell, the proud and pretty one. The pirate game was a game of imagination, but when I actually tried, I could feel my wings carrying me to Neverland. I would battle with Captain Hook – his fist caught me dead on the ears; I attacked with my sword and missed by an inch; while he tried to hook my sword, I ducked and pushed him to the edge of the boat. Just before I was going to stab him, a high-pitch Tinker Bell-like voice interrupted me.</p>
    <p>“Hi!” </p>
    <p>I looked up and saw a skinny white girl with blond hair cascading down her shoulders to her knees, standing about two stairs above me. She was good-looking, but I hated her. I could usually decide who was my friend and who was my enemy at first sight. Her high-pitch voice was not a good sign; plus, she distracted me from defeating Captain Hook. Never hiding my feelings from anyone, I allowed my anger to burn freely in my eyes.</p>
    <p>“Hi!” she spoke again, even more dramatic than her first greeting.</p>
    <p>I stood like a statue because I didn’t know where to go. On the other hand, she dashed toward me, two stairs at a time. Within seconds, she was standing right in front of me. Studying me as if I were from another world, she said, “Are you deaf?”</p>
    <p>“Do you have manners?” I could not believe what I heard.</p>
    <p>“No.” She smiled. “I’ve never seen someone like you before.”</p>
    <p>I remained silent, thinking if there existed someone even more annoying than Lisa, it must be this girl.</p>
    <p>“You are black.” She continued to study me and intended to touch my braids.</p>
    <p>I clutched at her wrist and pulled her hand down. She did not grumble; instead, she asked me what I was doing.</p>
    <p>“I was playing the pirate game until you interrupted me.” I turned away and slipped on the stairs. She watched me getting up in a way that people watched their pets playing on the grass. Then she asked me, “Can I join you?”</p>
    <p>“Fine, but you are Captain Hook.” In my mind, I had already stabbed her with my sword.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>The morning light struck me awake. Snoring quietly, Peter still had his arms around my waist. I rubbed my eyes and tried to remember my dreams, stretching my legs that no longer seemed to belong to me. I felt sick, but my pain gave me an eerie ecstasy. I guessed it was the same feeling that a drug addict would have after being injected with heroine. The light hurt my eyes. The sour taste in my mouth made me feel nauseous. I wished I could curl up in darkness forever and ever. I tried to fly in my mind, my wings beating futilely in the bed.</p>
    <p>Later, I screamed at the blood I saw on the sheets and woke Peter up. I sobbed in the bathroom for a long time, repeating “I’m sorry, mama; I’m sorry.” Someone must have broken my wings.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>Lisa wanted to get everything she saw in the shop: an Alice in Wonderland mug, a Tigger-stuffed animal, and a Toy Story shirt. She wanted to take a picture with every princess: Aurora, Cinderella, Snow White, Ariel, Belle, Jasmine, and I didn’t know the names of the others. I told her to check the price tags before buying souvenirs and to make sure the pictures were free of charge, but she kept putting things onto the counter, and when the saleswomen asked mother to pay, Lisa put on her sweet voice and said, “Yes, I want them all.”</p>
    <p>I was very disappointed with her. I had been saving allowance for years from used books and second-hand clothing to buy one butterfly necklace, with a complementary hairpin, in the clearance section. Yet she spent all mother’s money in one day. Girls like her would never have their fairy-tale ending, I thought. One day, she would be old and ugly; no prince charming would be love her and no one would pay her bills. I found surprising pleasure in defaming my sister, yet as I remembered my promise of not smiling during the trip, I held back my guilty indulgence.</p>
    <p>Lisa was afraid of any ride that went faster than the little train. Leaving her behind, I jumped on one ride after another. The most exciting one was the “Neverland Adventure” because I could play my pirate game in real settings. With the ups and downs of the roller coaster, I proceeded and retreated, dodged and attacked, waving my sword and soaring across the forests and lakes as if I were, indeed, Peter Pan.</p>
    <p>I had never been so happy that even the presence of the high-pitch girl did not irritate me that evening. Telling her about the rides, I said, “All of sudden, an elephant would come out from behind the tree and water our boat with its trunk.”</p>
    <p>“Then, the giraffes would bow down to you; the crocodiles would crawl into the sand; and you heard Captain Hook’s voice, ‘Prepare to die, Peter Pan.’” She described the animals and the special effects as if she were on the ride with me.</p>
    <p>“Are you also a Peter Pan fan? We should go to Disney together tomorrow.” Regarding roller coaster rides, she might be a better companion than Lisa.</p>
    <p>“No, I’ve been there thousands of times.” She sounded not just disinterested, but also disgusted by the idea.</p>
    <p>“Why?” </p>
    <p>She cut me short and suggested we play the pirate game again in the hallways.</p>
    <p>I was utterly confused&mdash;days after days, I never saw her in the Disney World, but she knew the position of every single tree and sign and shop. She even memorized the daily show schedule for the Water World and the Sesame Street. Furthermore, she never got lost in the hotel. Wherever we were, she could direct me back to my room in no time. She was such a strange person.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>My father gripped my hand in his rough palm as we walked through the longest distance on earth – the way leading to my groom. I would sprint toward this man, but I had to go step by step, synchronizing my pace with my breath. I was the focus of the room. Even Lisa was smiling genuinely at me as I passed by. Mother burst into tears that made her face shine like pearls under the light. I never felt so beautiful before, and for a split second, I almost forgot I was black.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>I enjoyed hearing the high-pitch girl recap those subtle details in the Disney World. Along with her description, I could revisit the parades and retake the rides any time I fancied. We played in the corridor every night, but she refused to show me her room until the evening before I left for home. I supposed her room was just like mine and there was nothing to do there.</p>
    <p>In the elevator, she pressed the button for the top floor. When we walked out of the elevator, I saw no hallways full of wooden doors, but one huge white double-door with gold handles. She kicked the doors open and dragged me inside. Unlike the normal standard room, which was the only type I had ever seen, her suite was much more than two queen beds, a desk, and a television. She had a living room full of cushions, a gigantic kitchen with refrigerator, three bedrooms, and a saloon with a piano in it. Although neatly stacked, five huge suitcases appeared odd in the room. The entire suite was surrounded by glass, overseeing the castle in the Disney World. I was totally awed by the gorgeous view, yet she ignored everything and started playing video games on one of her cushions. The street lamps reflected onto the ceiling like stars in the sky. I tired to reach for them, but they were just shadows that flickered away.</p>
    <p>I had so many questions to ask that I did not where to begin, so I stood there with my mouth open, wondering if this place was the Neverland in our world. Someone tapped on my shoulders. As I turned back, I saw a middle-aged woman that was an exact copy of the high-pitch girl, with blond hair streaming down to her knees. She said in the same high-pitch voice, “Are you hungry?”</p>
    <p>All I had for meals this week were take-outs; surely, I was enthusiastic about the idea that she was going to cook something for us in the kitchen. However, she did not go to the kitchen. Instead, she took out three menus from the drawer and explained, “The three entrees for today’s dinner are Lemon Garlic Fish with Dill Creamy Risotto, Crab Cakes with Roasted Pepper and Asparagus, and Braised Beef Short Ribs on Tomato Polenta. If you don’t like any of these main courses, I could ask the chef to cook whatever you want, but it may take a little longer.”</p>
    <p>While the mother was speaking, the girl’s face reddened up and her eyes bulged like those of a blowfish. She was trembling in the cushion as if she were to explode. Suddenly, she grabbed my hand and yelled, “Let’s go!”</p>
    <p>Before I realized, we were out of Neverland, flying down the staircase. She did not say a single word, so I thought I had better keep my mouth shut too. In fact, I couldn’t open it even if I wanted to, as if she controlled the zip across my lips. At that instant, she zipped it closed and placed a lock onto it. Hearing the wind whooshing by my ears, I was unaware of my feet touching the ground. My back was itchy as if something was cracking out of it. Maybe, for a second, I was actually flying with wings too tiny to be seen.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>The priest said, “You may kiss the bride.” And he held his palms against mine, knotting our fingers together. I felt small, very small like a baby, and protected, very protected like children in Neverland. The warmness of his breath blended into mine. For the first time in my life, I kissed with my eyes open, watching how our lips were drawn and stuck to each other like magnets. My whole body loosened into a pile of sand that swirled and flattened according to his guidance. A cliché said that life was a box of chocolates. Then I said this one, without any doubt, was very rich – triple dark chocolate mousse.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>As we ran off the stairs, the penetration of light decreased flights by flights. Shortly, we were in the basement of the building. As soon as we stopped, I remembered to breathe again, and as air rushed into my lungs, my body was about to collapse under this sudden pressure. She did not seem to be affected in any noticeable way as if sprinting was her daily routine. It was hard for me to imagine this pale white girl running with her blond hair dragging behind her.</p>
    <p>She opened the door leading to the outside&mdash;an incredibly stunning half-moon floated on the ground. When I touched it, it wiggled and faded and turned back into a half-moon again. I was glad to be here because I would be sorry to not visit this place before I returned home.</p>
    <p>“I’m going for swim,” she said, untying her white beach dress and revealing her smooth skin between the top and bottom parts of her swimsuit. The evening breeze was quite chilly, but she did not bother to test the temperature of water before jumping in. I watched her swim back and forth three times. Then she stretched her neck and said, “Aren’t you coming?”</p>
    <p>“I…I don’t have a swimsuit underneath my clothes.” I was not a very good swimmer either.</p>
    <p>“Just wear your underwear.” She hopped out of the swimming pool and sit by the edge, waiting.</p>
    <p>I had never appeared nude, or nearly nude in this case, in front of anyone. As I stripped off my shirt and jeans, she played with the half-moon in water. I awkwardly touched the water with my toes, gasping how cold it was. Slowly slipping into the pool, I wrapped my arms around my body to keep warmth.</p>
    <p>“I hate my mom,” she said, still sitting at the edge and kicking the water with her feet.</p>
    <p>I did not hate my mother, yet I wanted to console the girl, so I added, “My mom sometimes annoys me too.”</p>
    <p>“I hate my dad as well.” It seemed as if some invisible evil spirits were twisting her face out of its usual handsome shape.</p>
    <p>“At least you have one,” I said. “Some people are not that lucky.” Her open hatred toward her parents made me uneasy. I shivered more rigorously under the water.</p>
    <p>She thought about my comment for a moment and replied, not to me, but to herself, “Yeah, you are right.”</p>
    <p>I realized it was my last night with her and we might never meet again in our lives. Remembering her baggage, I assumed she must have lived far away. A sour, melancholy taste lingered in my mouth. I wanted to cry, to make up for my nastiness when I first talked to her, but I could not squeeze any tear out of my eyes.</p>
    <p>“Where do you live?” I finally asked.</p>
    <p>“I live here.” Her voice lost the sharpness in pitch. “My father owns the hotel.”</p>
    <p>I felt sorry for her, wondering what it meant to not have a real home, to have maids make her bed every morning, and to be on vacation forever. What was money to her? It was emotionless and sleepless, fatherless and motherless, friendless and homeless. I put my arms around her, sympathizing the little girl, poorer than I was. If we had no money, we could work for it; but if we had no shelter, no shelter with love, there was nothing we could do.</p>
    <p>“I will miss you,” I said.</p>
    <p>“I will miss you too.” She tried to fake a smile. “I think you are my best friend.”</p>
    <p>She jumped back into the water, staring at me, straight into my pupils. I felt something truly fascinating was happening.</p>
    <p>“Have you ever kissed anyone?” she asked, not blinking her champagne-colored eyes.</p>
    <p>I shook my head. Part of me hoped to embrace her immediately, but my bony skeleton held me in place. I thought only boys kissed girls, and my first kiss should be with a man I chose to spend the rest of my life with. I felt myself sweating inside, like children being scared of growing up, not able to revisit Neverland.</p>
    <p>And she kissed me. A succinct, dry kiss under the water.</p>
    <p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
    <p>Once, I could fly, up above in the sky. I promised her in silence, when my wings grew strong enough, I would meet her again in Neverland. I would be the first black girl to ever reach the terrain of dream.</p>

    <p>Applicant’s name: Zoe Lu</p>
    <p>Essay prompt: Describe how you see yourself fit in the Ivy University of Ultimate Perfection. Please limit your response to 1200 words.</p>
    <p>Growing up in the town of Ivy, I consider Ivy University as my second home. Having spent every Saturday afternoon on its tree-shaded quad, I feel a strong sense of belonging when I observe the diversity of the student body here. As a girl with unusual race, sexual orientation, and religion, I am always the target of discrimination. At Ivy, however, I no longer need to be ashamed of my background; instead, I could further contribute to this amazing diversity. Even though I look completely Asian, I am actually 5% Jamaican, 3.5% Egyptian, 2% Jewish, 1% Scandinavian, and maybe 0.5% Cherokee. Although my classmates often make fun of my Native American heritage, I regard it as an essential part of my identity. My unique sexual orientation also shapes me into who I am today. In addition to being bisexual, I have a fascination with trees, whose luscious leaves never fail to intrigue me. Rather than a hypocritical nature-lover, I am willing to devote my life to the sustainable development of this planet. Aiming to restore the balance between humans and the nature, I joined the Church of Euthanasia five years ago. I believe it is time to stand up against procreate activists and practice sodomy, abortion, cannibalism, and suicide in order to save the planet. Undoubtedly, the liberal atmosphere of Ivy University will not prevent me from killing myself or encouraging my peers to do the same.
</p>
    <p>Besides being a part of the diverse student body, I look forward to engaging in as many extracurricular activities as possible to take advantage of the 566 clubs and organizations Ivy has. While many universities boast about the variety of their student clubs, few are capable of claiming that their students join these clubs out of genuine interest. On the other hand, I believe Ivy students are motivated by their passion and not résumé building. After browsing through the descriptions of Ivy’s student clubs and organizations, I am particularly keen to join the Phi Kappa Phi Honor Society, the Senior Classical League, the National Forensic League, the Phi Alpha Theta Honor Society, the Student Government Association, the Volunteer Association, the Peer Mentoring programs, and the National Honor Society. Just as I appreciate the variety of clubs at Ivy, I also value the ease of starting new ones because I want to continue running a club which I founded in high school. After gaining some leadership experience as the head of the Math Club, the Sustainability Board, and the Ginger Beer Society, I started the Social Observation Club two years ago to raise students’ communal awareness. During our meetings, we log on to non-members’ Facebook accounts to analyze their posts and message their friends, so we can get a sense of how our peers conduct themselves in private. Sometimes we also go on people-watching field trips, during which we use binoculars to observe couples at a safe distance. Offering first-hand guidance on how to kiss, make out, and break up, these trips help teenagers excel in their social lives. I hope to bring this club to the Ivy campus to benefit more students. This same love for community prompts me to participate extensively in community service, which many Ivy students are equally passionate about. In the past four years, I have run a hundred miles for chimpanzees in Congo, baked six hundred cookies for homeless pets, and plunged into freezing water eight times for people suffering from the human werewolf syndrome. When I see kids with this peculiar disorder howling at their neighbors and struggling to walk with their two hind feet, I promise myself that one day, I would help them return to savannas where they could reunite with their wolf mothers.</p>
    <p>While connecting with the outside world through community service, Ivy students bond with each other and the faculty members through mutual support. I know by reputation that Ivy University prides on its tightly knit community in which students and faculty freely share their knowledge and much more. I am excited to live in co-ed dorms where students of different genders are able to develop intimate relationships. By encouraging students to engage in sexual activities as they see fit, Ivy University eliminates the hypocrisy of other colleges’ strict rules and strengthens students’ support for each other. I learned from a friend currently enrolled in Ivy University that the school seems to allow the same intimate relationships between faculty members and students. Believing that to share is to gain, I agree with the school’s philosophy which inspires students to enhance their academic performance by learning from their professors outside the classroom.</p>
    <p>As much as I value diversity, leadership, and community, I am most enthusiastic about Ivy’s challenging yet rewarding academic curriculum. The packed library at three in the morning demonstrates that Ivy students are serious scholars who hold their studies as their upmost priority. Like them, I firmly believe in the necessity of staying up late for academic advancement despite possible chronic sleep deprivation, memory loss, brain damage, digestive problems, anxiety, panic, irregular heart rhythms, weight gain, poor concentration, bad decision-making, mood swings, high blood pressure, heart failure, stroke, depression, and death. As future leaders of our nation, we have to make some sacrifice for the good of all citizens. By giving up a few hours of sleep every day, I have gained some precious time that enables me to attain perfect scores on ACT, SAT Reasoning Test, eight SAT Subject Tests, and fifteen AP tests; learn multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and abstract algebra; and study Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, Russian, Turkish, German, Greek, Latin, Chinese, and Navajo. Determined to achieve academic excellence in many fields, I would definitely fit in Ivy’s stimulating environment.</p>
    <p>Most Ivy students, however, go beyond their academic achievements and strive for equal athletic and artistic excellence. Holding myself to the same standard, I captain three varsity sports teams, compete in national and international squash tournaments, play the first-violin in New York Youth Symphony, dance for the New York City Ballet, and organize my own annual art exhibitions. I would never forget the victory of my soccer team in the state championship. Although I was severely injured when competing for the ball with a girl on the opponent team, I stayed on court for the entire game and scored a decisive goal in the last five minutes. If I have the honor to join Ivy’s varsity soccer team, I would certainly bring this level of commitment and team spirit to the group. Whereas participating in sports refines my teamwork skills, engaging in artistic endeavors promotes my ability to think creatively. In a New Year concert at the Carnegie Hall, one of my violin strings broke during my solo. Reacting quickly to the emergency, I cut another three strings in front of the audience and resumed my piece on a single string. Just as Ivy University pushes its students to their full potential, I challenge myself to think outside the box and act beyond my comfort zone.</p>
    <p>Already feeling like home at Ivy University of Ultimate Perfection, I cannot wait to spend the next four years at this remarkable place, sharing my experience with peers and faculty, participating in extracurricular activities, and cheering proudly at athletic games: Go Big Green!

    <h1>When the Canola Flowers Bloom</h1>
    <p><i>Canola flowers bloom, <br>
	Canola flowers bloom,<br>
	Is it time for the canola flowers to bloom?</i>
</p>
    <p><i>A field of gold,<br>
	A layer of green,<br>
	They fragranced my childhood memories.</i>
</p>
	<p>Lin and Mei hummed the song together as they lay in the field of canola blossoms kept by Lin’s grandparents.</p>
	<p>“What do you want to do when you grow up?” Mei asked.</p>
	<p>“The Chairwoman of China,” Lin said, “or an accountant.”</p>
	<p>Lin was making a wreath for Mei, snapping the stems as she tried to tie them together.</p>
	<p>“There hasn’t been any Chairwoman in China,” Mei said, turning around to look at Lin, who was busy knotting the flowers.</p>
	<p>“That’s why I want to be one. But an accountant is great too because I like doing math.”</p>
	<p>Lin smiled in triumph at the knot she made.</p>
	<p>“What about you? What do you want to do?” she asked, putting the wreath on Mei’s face.</p>
	<p>“An American!” Mei chuckled, “Or just your best friend.”</p>
	<p>“Why American?”</p>
	<p>Lin didn’t hear the latter part.</p>
	<p>“Oh, I don’t know. They say people are all happy and rich there.”</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>So this is America, Lin thought, leaning against the bare wall in the empty dorm room. The air-conditioner was broken and she felt like a fish on land. She supposed she should call this feeling <i>shui tu bu fu</i>, or “acclimation,” as how they say in English.</p>
	<p>She wanted to call her parents, but remembered that there was a twelve-hour time difference—it was 7 a.m. in China and her parents were probably opening up their grocery store. Her family lived in a small town about ninety miles away from Shenzhen, the nearest city. Before coming to America, she was the big star in town. Her mother told everyone that she was accepted by a college in New York, <i>the capital city</i>.</p>
	<p>As Lin went back and forth to translate her thoughts from Chinese to English, she heard a squeak of the door that almost made her jump. A tan-skinned girl in bohemian floral dress popped in. </p>
	<p>“How…how do you do?” Lin stammered.</p>
	<p>“How do you do?” the girl laughed. “We don’t say that.”</p>
	<p>Lin felt defeated. Back home, she spoke better English than her teacher in high school. Of course, her teacher was there not because he majored in English but simply because he’d gone to college. In her town, that was enough. A college degree was everything.</p>
	<p>“Ugh, it smells gross here,” the girl said as she took off her earphones and sat on the metal frame of the bed.</p>
	<p>Lin sniffed at her shirt.</p>
	<p>“My name’s Emily. Call me Em.”</p>
	<p>Lin quickly moved to the other bed at the opposite side of the room.</p>
	<p>“Nice to meet you, Miss Emily. My name is Lin.”</p>
	<p>Emily shook her head and laughed again. </p>
	<p>Lin thought Emily looked at her as the immigration officer did at the airport. She remembered that he’d asked her why she came to America and she said, “Study.” </p>
	<p>“They come and they never want to leave,” he murmured to himself, stamping her date of entrance onto her passport.</p>
	<p>“So what classes are you taking?” </p>
	<p>Emily started to unpack. Lin didn’t move.</p>
	<p>“Foundations of Finance, Behavioral Economics, Business and Its Politics….” Lin read off her schedule, already crumbled because she’d read it so many times.</p>
	<p>“Business major. I hope you get along with your classmates here.” </p>
	<p>Emily pinned up a poster of Justin Timberlake, with slanted sunshine outlining the curve of his abs and biceps.</p>
	<p>“Behavioral Economics with Charlotte Johnson?” Emily asked.</p>
	<p>“Professor Johnson, yes, Professor….” </p>
	<p>Lin was not so worried about getting along with her classmates, but she hoped she would get used to waking up to see a naked man.</p>
	<p>“Well, she likes to be called Charlotte. My brother was a business major here too.”</p>
	<p>Lin tried to picture Emily’s brother, tan-skinned, goatee beard, smoking—she wanted to think cigarettes, but she knew hippie Americans smoked something else. </p>
	<p>In no time, Emily covered her side of the room with posters, lights, and plants. Lin was almost afraid that her roommate’s ivy would creep onto her bed the next morning.</p>
	<p>Emily said nothing more. Lin took a deep breath as she slowly opened her untouched luggage, hesitating as she ripped off the tag that had “Shenzhen” printed on it. I’ve left home, she thought, and Shenzhen is just a name that people toss into the trashcan now.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>When they started learning about Chinese geography in kindergarten, Lin and Mei thought Shenzhen was the farthest place they could reach. Then in first grade, their teacher told them about airplanes that could take them beyond the border of China. The thought of flying to America stirred their little hearts and they responded to this excitement by folding paper planes. They folded planes before going to sleep, on the way to school, and even during class, though they were often punished with afternoon detentions and had to wait until the next day to test out their planes on the playground.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>Across the quad was Tisch Hall. Lin checked the plaque against the location on her schedule three times before she went in. She didn’t sleep because it was hot and Emily snored. Or because I’m in America, she thought—people don’t sleep in America. It was somewhat true. All freshmen had gone to a party in the common room, but she went to bed at nine o’clock. She hadn’t the slightest idea of how a party was supposed to be, so she thought it must be like the Spring Festival celebration when the family got together for a feast and then watched television later. Yet she smelled alcohol when Emily slammed the door open at three in the morning. She wondered why.</p>
	<p>The building was very quiet. Lin was thirty minutes early because, in high school, everyone was early for classes. It was rude to be on time. Here, however, she was the first to push open the door of the lecture hall.</p>
	<p>In front of the lecture hall, she saw a middle-aged woman flipping through the <i>New York Times</i>. That woman must be Professor Johnson, Lin thought, or Charlotte. She noticed the flat mole on Charlotte’s cheek, like her own mother’s mole. Lin had it too when she was younger—her mother called it a beauty spot—but, as Lin grew older, it faded away. The color of Charlotte’s hair reminded Lin of canola blooms. Lin’s grandparents were farmers and Lin loved visiting them during the flowering season of canola. Sometimes, she would lie in the field of gold until bees started hovering over her faces, mistaking her for a canola blossom.</p>
	<p>“Take a seat,” Charlotte said, suddenly looking up from the newspaper.</p>
	<p>“Good morning. My…my…..”</p>
	<p>Lin hadn’t got over her anxiety about talking to native speakers. She felt they either judged her or pitied her. But Charlotte looked at her differently, as how a mother looked at her child.</p>
	<p>“Your name is Lin, right?” Charlotte said.</p>
	<p>Lin was surprised because half of her high school teachers still got her name wrong by the time she graduated.</p>
	<p>“I like to get a head start on students’ names,” Charlotte explained, “especially for these big lecture classes.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte took out the student directory and showed Lin her photo with her name written below. Lin wished she could have her photo changed as soon as possible. Glancing over her classmates’ directory pictures, she saw one taken in a stable, one on top of a mountain, still another by the family yacht. And hers, hers was taken with a blank background drop in a little shop designated for taking photos.</p>
	<p>“You do look tired, my dear. Please take a seat.”</p>
	<p>Seeing Charlotte was about to get up, Lin mechanically sat down on the nearest chair.</p>
	<p>“Thank you, Professor….”</p>
	<p>“Charlotte.”</p>
	<p>“Thank you, Charlotte.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte smiled at Lin again and went back to reading the newspaper.</p>
	<p>Lin was glad that Charlotte didn’t interrogate her on her hometown or family or how she learned English. After stealing another look at Charlotte’s hair, she closed her eyes, and for the first time since she arrived at the United States, she felt rather “acclimated.” In the air, she smelled a vague scent of canola flowers, but the fragrance disappeared as she heard footsteps coming closer.</p>
	<p>“Charlotte! What a pleasure to see you again!”</p>
	<p>Lin saw a lean, brown-haired boy in suit walking in, holding out his hand to shake Charlotte’s. His face looked vaguely familiar. He was the one next to the yacht, Lin remembered. It was more accurate to say that he looked like a man, not a boy. Lin started to consider her T-shirt and jeans extremely inadequate, even inappropriate. </p>
	<p>“Good morning, Mr. Hertzberg. I hope you know you are coming to a lecture instead of a dinner party,” Charlotte said, giving him a firm handshake.</p>
	<p>“Of course. The dinner party is soon though. I’m sure my parents and brothers will be happy to see you.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte didn’t respond. Hertzberg caught a glimpse of Lin and then walked straight to the back of the lecture hall.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>In third grade, Mei said that she had a huge crush on the boy sitting in front of her.</p>
	<p>“What does a ‘crush’ mean?” Lin asked.</p>
	<p>“It means you want to be with someone all the time.”</p>
	<p>Lin felt a little jealous because <i>she</i> wanted to be with Mei all the time. She wondered if Mei liked him more or if it’d be possible for Mei to like two people at the same time.</p>
	<p>“What would you do with him?” Lin asked again.</p>
	<p>Mei looked at the ceiling and hesitated a little.</p>
	<p>“I hope to take him to a field of canola flowers,” Mei said. “And we would just lie there forever.”</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>Lin never really understood boys, but Nate Hertzberg was so strange that he made her feel uncomfortable. Sometimes, she felt he was staring at her during lectures, though he never greeted her when they met in the hallway. The second Monday since the commencement, she found an invitation to a Sunday frat party from him in her mailbox. The party was on September 27th, the fifteenth day of the eighth month in the lunar calendar. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
	<p>“Invitation to a frat party from Nate?”</p>
	<p>Emily jumped off her bed when Lin broke the news to her on Sunday morning.</p>
	<p>“I also got his invitation,” Emily said. “One of Nate’s older brother was best friends with my brother. They lived in the same frat house, which is the one Nate is living in now.”</p>
	<p>Sitting on her bed in pajamas, Emily examined Lin’s invitation letter. She was about to say something but didn’t. Stretching her arms and yawning, she simply mumbled, “I assume you’ve never been to a frat party before.”</p>
	<p>Lin shook her head, keeping her eyes on the ground.</p>
	<p>“Do you have a costume?”</p>
	<p>“No.”</p>
	<p>“Make-up?”</p>
	<p>“No.”</p>
	<p>Emily fell back onto her bed and said, “I guess you can borrow mine.”</p>
	<p>Soon enough, Emily started snoring again. Lin stared at the Justin Timberlake poster on Emily’s wall, feeling uneasy and corrupted.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>By six o’clock, Emily had wrapped Lin in a black dress, powdered her face white, put on red lipstick for her, and called it a vampire costume. Lin thought her outfit looked terrible. She’d never dreamed that she would be dressing up as a zombie on the Mid-Autumn Festival. The whiteness of her skin seemed especially frightening.</p>
	<p>As she entered the frat house, Lin had little idea of what Greek life entailed, but she was familiar with the communes in Old China. Soon, she realized that fraternity and commune were far from being synonymous. The alcohol spill on the floor made her want to cry because she should’ve been helping her mother prepare the family dinner and sharing homemade red bean moon cakes with neighbors. She should’ve been happy.</p>
	<p>“Are you staying late?” she asked Emily.</p>
	<p>“When in America, do as the Americans do.”</p>
	<p>Emily pulled her strapless top lower.</p>
	<p>Lin shuddered to see her roommate’s cleavage and quickly looked away.</p>
	<p>“Go have fun. Don’t leave without me, okay?”</p>
	<p>Emily gave Lin a slight push and walked to meet some boy whom Lin remembered seeing in their room before.</p>
	<p>“Lin!”</p>
	<p>Nate Hertzberg was calling her name from upstairs.</p>
	<p>She stared at him and didn’t move. She thought she saw him smiling as he disappeared by the staircase. She felt like a fish biting into the bait.</p>
	<p>“I wasn’t expecting you to come.”</p>
	<p>Nate whispered to her from behind, putting his left arm around her waist. She stiffened up and became paler than the white powder on her face. His vodka breath mixed with the blasting techno music dizzied her. She felt so sick that she couldn’t speak when he grabbed her hand.</p>
	<p>“Relax,” he said, kissing her cheek.</p>
	<p>She knew he was leading her upstairs, but she couldn’t feel her feet moving. Nate unlocked a door and almost carried her into a room scented with lotus fragrance.</p>
	<p>He put his arms around her neck and pulled her closer, his hot skin burning hers.</p>
	<p>“I want you to stay,” he said, kissing her forehead, her cheek, and her neck. </p>
	<p>She felt as if she were shrinking, every second getting number and disappearing into the darkness.</p>
	<p>“I think I’m in love with you.”</p>
	<p>Nate’s voice became very distant. The pressure on her lips seemed to shrink her even more until she collapsed into a little girl. She remembered that when she was six, she and Mei used to make perfume from lotus flowers in summer. She always left hers in her room, but Mei would put it on her neck before they went out to play. As they ran down the street, she sometimes noticed little boys peeking at Mei.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>When she woke up, she found herself lying alone on the ground. She opened the window, letting the wind sting her dry face. The night had turned very cold. The moon looked icy. The cold made it rather painful for her to cry. She didn’t know what happened exactly, but she had the strange feeling that if she called her parents and asked them to help her make sense of her memories, they would disown her.</p>
	<p>She went through the short list of contacts on her phone—Emily, the Health Center, and professors. She didn’t want to call the Health Center because the nurses would ask too many questions.</p>
	<p>She dialed Charlotte’s number.</p>
	<p>“Prof—, Charlotte?”</p>
	<p>“Yes? Are you okay, Lin?”</p>
	<p>This was the first time someone asked her if she was okay since she came here. She had so many nonchalant “what’s up”s in the past month that she forgot how to respond to this question.</p>
	<p>“Lin? Where are you, Lin?”</p>
	<p>She heard a rustle of Charlotte getting up, finding keys, and opening the door. The moon continued to be full and bright. She thought about how her mother must be busy making the red bean stuffing for moon cakes. Lin still couldn’t feel her fingers and feet. She tried very hard to squeeze words out of her mouth.</p>
	<p>“Nate Hertzberg,” she finally whispered.</p>
	<p>“His house?” Charlotte gasped, “Just wait there. I’m coming to get you.”</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>Lin turned on the lights and walked around the room. It looked as if it belonged to a girl. There were no sportswear, sweatshirts, or opened food packages on the floor. The bed was made and all books were stacked up neatly on the shelf.</p>
	<p>The lotus smell lingered in the air.</p>
	<p>She saw a photo of the Hertzbergs on the desk. Though shuffled to the corner, it was rather conspicuous because of its beautifully carved wooden frame. Nate couldn’t be more than twelve years old in the photo. The family was playing golf, but Nate seemed as though he didn’t want to be there.</p>
	<p>Lin thought about the photo for a while until her phone rang.</p>
	<p>“I’m outside the house,” Charlotte said, sounding out of breath.</p>
	<p>“En,” Lin murmured. Then, she remembered Emily telling her how impolite one-syllable responses were in America, so she corrected herself and said, “Thank you.”</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>As soon as she got into Charlotte’s car, Lin had her senses back and burst into tears. “<i>Wo yao hui jia</i>,” she cried. “I want to go home.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte soaked away Lin’s tears and patted on her back.</p>
	<p>“I can’t help you with that now,” she sighed.</p>
	<p>Lin cried even louder, avoiding looking at the giant moon outside the window. Her mother used to say that the moon appeared particularly full and bright in foreign places on the Mid-Autumn Festival, reminding travellers how much they missed home. </p>
	<p>“Do you want me to drive you back?” Charlotte asked.</p>
	<p>Lin didn’t want to go back. She was afraid that the upperclassmen in her dorm would start to call her a whore, the freshmen would hover around her to interrogate her how the party went, and Emily would scorn her for leaving the party by herself. Emily would say that it was, again, one of Lin’s bad <i>Chinese habits</i>.</p>
	<p>So she just gazed at Charlotte, scared and melancholy.</p>
	<p>Charlotte tried to smile but couldn’t. </p>
	<p>“Which house do you live in?”</p>
	<p>“Brittany,” Lin said, sobbing quietly.</p>
	<p>Lin was frustrated and she didn’t know why. Maybe she was expecting Charlotte to offer her something—more tissue paper, a cup of tea, or a request to stay with her.</p>
	<p>On the way to Brittany, Lin observed Charlotte’s features again under the moonlight. Though Charlotte was not crying, Lin felt as if she saw water flowing in her grey eyes. </p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>Lin’s grandfather once told her that he could see only wood in Lin’s eyes. She was a stiff, wooden child. Her grandparents always liked her cousins more. She could tell when the family got together for holiday feasts and her grandparents would urge her cousins to taste this dish and try that fruit, but she was often left alone to herself. She also remembered the time when she played with her cousins in their grandparents’ fields, and they would tell her cousins to be careful and come home before dark, but they never said anything to her. </p>
	<p>“Lin can take care of herself,” her grandmother said.</p>
	<p>“Ah, Lin is wood” was her grandfather’s reply. “She needs water to bend her and wear off her coarseness.”</p>
	<p>Lin wasn’t very fond of water. And how water could bend her—she didn’t understand.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>Charlotte turned off the car’s engine in front of Brittany.</p>
	<p>“I’ll stay with you for a while,” Charlotte said, “in case you need anything.”</p>
	<p>Lin didn’t turn on the overhead lights in her room, but just the lamp by her bedside.</p>
	<p>“Would you sit next to me?” she asked Charlotte, her fingers scratching back and forth on the clean linen sheet. When Charlotte sat down, Lin turned towards her and pleaded, “Please don’t tell anyone what happened tonight.”</p>
	<p>“I’m afraid I have to. It’s my obligation to file a report.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte’s lips trembled. There was so much water in her eyes that they actually rounded into tears.</p>
	<p>The wood in Lin resisted the water. It was after lunchtime in China. She thought her parents must’ve been sweeping their apartment, so they’d be ready to receive guests. Her grandfather might notice that she was missing, and he might ask as he sipped his green tea, “When will Lin come home? After the first snow or when the swallows sing?”</p>
	<p>She wondered what her parents would say if they knew what had happened to her. </p>
	<p>Lin’s body shook in panic.</p>
	<p>“I beg you, Charlotte. Don’t tell.”</p>
	<p>She gripped Charlotte’s hands, the way a drowning person hold onto a log. </p>
	<p>“I could lose my job,” Charlotte said.</p>
	<p>“I beg you,” Lin mumbled. “I beg you.”</p>
	<p>Her grip on Charlotte’s hands loosened into an embrace. Charlotte sighed as Lin’s tears and sweat wetted the front of her shirt.</p>
	<p>“You can’t just let it pass, Lin. You can’t let people hurt you as they please.”</p>
	<p>Lin let go of Charlotte’s grasp and sat back up. She looked like a phantom with the moon shining on her pale skin and messy hair.</p>
	<p>“Don’t tell,” she spoke again, with uncommon articulation. “I won’t let it pass. I won’t let people hurt me again.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte looked at Lin, then at the chilly moon, then back at Lin again. Lin saw waves crashing into waves in Charlotte’s eyes, but Lin was determined that she wouldn’t let the water bend her.</p>
	<p>“There’s no next time,” Charlotte said, stroking Lin’s hair behind her ears.</p>
	<p>Lin smiled. She could imagine her mother answering her grandfather, “Lin’s coming home soon, just before the canola flowers bloom.” That night, Lin dreamed of lying in the canola field. The grass was soft and she was warm.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>The following Tuesday in the dining hall, Nate came over to Lin during lunch, who was sitting alone as usual. He asked her if he they could eat together. Lin opened her mouth to say no, but remembered the frown on little Nate’s face that she saw in the photo last Sunday.</p>
	<p>Nate was frowning again.</p>
	<p>Lin looked around the dining hall and felt as if everyone were talking about her.</p>
	<p>Nate looked around too and said, “Maybe I’d better—”</p>
	<p>“You may sit,” Lin interrupted.</p>
	<p>As Nate slid into the chair opposite to Lin, he began speaking rather rapidly, “I’m terribly sorry about what happened last Sunday. It was just a kiss and you fainted. I promise I didn’t do anything else to you. I….”</p>
	<p>The reddish hue on his face reminded Lin of the setting sun. The town she lived in didn’t have any skyscrapers and the highest place was a little hill to the south of her apartment. When they got out of school early, Lin and her friends liked to climb up the hill to watch the sun sinking down the horizon.</p>
	<p>“I didn’t mean to,” Nate said.</p>
	<p>He was staring at his food, trying to separate them according to their colors.</p>
	<p>Lin watched him sorting the mix of peas and corns into two piles and thought he looked pitiful. She remembered that in kindergarten, only kids without friends played with their food during lunch because they had no one to talk to.</p>
	<p>“You won’t forgive me, but I’m going to ask anyway if you’ll forgive me.”</p>
	<p>If Lin didn’t know Nate Hertzberg, she would’ve laughed at him. He really did seem like a kindergarten kid.</p>
	<p>“I…I mean would you forgive me please?”</p>
	<p>Nate’s face was outright burning. Lin could feel the air between them heating up.</p>
	<p>He was still staring at his food and Lin never forgave anyone who didn’t look into her eyes while apologizing.</p>
	<p>“No,” she said.</p>
	<p>Nate looked up as if he was awake from a nightmare.</p>
	<p>“Nate, I don’t forgive you.”</p>
	<p>Lin stood up and walked out from the back door as quickly as she could, resisting her urge to turn back and look at Nate. “I won’t let people hurt me again,” she repeated to herself, “I won’t.”</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>The maple leaves on campus turned red. The brilliant color reminded her of the azalea flowers back home. Last spring, Mei insisted that they go watch azalea blazing across the hill one more time before Lin left for America. As they sat on the hilltop looking down the sea of magenta pink, Mei said quietly, “I’m engaged.”</p>
	<p>Lin took a deep breath and said, “To your neighbor? Why, Mei, you don’t love him.”</p>
	<p>“You are such an idealist,” Mei said, holding out her wrist to show Lin the silver bangle that her fiancé gave her. “Look, isn’t it pretty?”</p>
	<p>Lin understood perfectly that this engagement was Mei’s parents’ wish. Mei’s parents and her fiancé’s parents were friends before the kids were born: the two mothers worked together as waitresses for a while and the two fathers were roommates in college. Lin knew that the boy would treat Mei well, but somehow, she felt sorry for her friend, marrying so young to a person whom she respected but did not love.</p>
	<p>Mei waved her hand in front of Lin’s eyes and said, “You’re dazing off.”</p>
	<p>Lin shook her head and tried to fake a smile. </p>
	<p>“You’re right. I like to dream,” she said. “I’m sure you two will be happy together.”</p>
	<p>Mei chuckled, the way she did when the two girls lay side by side in the field of canola flowers.</p>
	<p>“I hope your dreams do come true,” she said to Lin.</p>
	<p>Then she grabbed Lin’s hands as they watched the fire of azalea flowers extending to the horizon, burning the edge of the clouds into a mix of gold and pink and purple. Lin felt as if she saw angels frolicking among the clouds, promising her that all her dreams would indeed come true.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>“Happy birthday!”</p>
	<p>Lin woke up to Emily’s face on the stressful Wednesday before midterms. Emily must’ve seen a Facebook notification, Lin thought, guessing that her roommate didn’t even know how old she was turning.</p>
	<p>The only other person who remembered Lin’s birthday was Charlotte, who asked Lin to come over to her house for tea after class.</p>
	<p>“I’d love to,” Lin said.</p>
	<p>She’d hoped to visit someone’s house ever since she came to the States because Emily told her that getting invited to an American’s house meant she really made a friend.</p>
	<p>Lin was busy imagining Charlotte’s house the entire afternoon, thinking how Charlotte must keep a cat, paint her walls yellow, and have a loving husband—a cat because Charlotte talked like one; the yellow walls could reflect the color of Charlotte’s hair; a loving husband to make Charlotte so sweet and considerate. Lin’s mother always said that the husband was the mountain and the wife was the water because the husband stood tall to support the family while the wife wrapped around him, so she could take care of the man who supported her. Maybe that’s why Charlotte’s eyes are full of water, Lin supposed.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>“I hope you won’t mind the mess,” Charlotte said as she turned her key.</p>
	<p>“Of course…”</p>
	<p>Lin entered the house, seeing an old cat snoozing by the door and the cracked walls painted yellow. Books and magazines were all over the floor that Charlotte had to tiptoe in the room to avoid being tripped over. A spider dangling from the ceiling made Lin almost scream.</p>
	<p>“This is <i>your</i> house?” Lin asked, rubbing her eyes and looked again, the spider still hanging in its web.</p>
	<p>“Yes. I know I’m a terrible housekeeper,” Charlotte said apologetically and disappeared into the kitchen.</p>
	<p>Lin skipped around the living room, so she could sit down by the greasy table just outside the kitchen. She wondered if the woman in front of her was indeed Charlotte or if she’d gone to the wrong house.</p>
	<p>“Jasmine tea, green tea, or Earl Grey?” Charlotte asked.</p>
	<p>Lin thought the name of the third kind sounded pretty, so she said, “Earl Grey, please.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte turned on the water boiler and took out two tea bags from the Twinings box. Still not used to the idea of making tea from tea bags, Lin recollected one of her favorite childhood memories as she helped local tea growers pick tealeaves from fields of evergreen shrubs. She remembered the giant wicker basket, the bittersweet fragrance on the tealeaves, and the reminder from the growers that only the tip and the first two or three leaves could be harvested. After a day’s work, she would fill her pockets with tealeaves and run back home to see her mother making xin cha, fresh leave tips slowly rolling out their curls in boiled water and dancing their way to the surface. She thought it was beautiful.</p>
	<p>Lin took a sip of the Earl Grey that Charlotte handed to her, shocked by the acidic flavor of the orange rind that she spitted a mouthful of tea back into the cup.</p>
	<p>“Are you okay?” Charlotte asked, rushing to Lin to clean up the splatter on her sweater.</p>
	<p>“I’m okay,” Lin said.” The tea is just…too sour.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte put down the tissue paper and looked up as if she was in pain, her grey eyes filled with tears. The old cat meowed, waking up from its nap.</p>
	<p>Lin tried to put her thoughts in words. “Charlotte, I don’t understand,” she murmured.</p>
	<p>“My dear,” Charlotte said with a trembling voice, “I don’t understand either.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte struggled to stand up and sat down next to Lin, her eyes still full of the tears that she tried to hold back.</p>
	<p>“Lin, today’s my daughter’s birthday too.”</p>
	<p>Her tears dropped down silently. There was no storm, no waves, just a stream of water flowing away.</p>
	<p>“Where’s your daughter?” Lin asked. She had a feeling that it was the wrong question, but she didn’t know what to say.</p>
	<p>Charlotte touched the cracks on the wall and said, “She drowned two years ago.”</p>
	<p>The spider climbed up its gossamer. The cat meowed again.</p>
	<p>Charlotte turned around. Her pallid face wrinkled into a frown. </p>
	<p>“Lily was adopted, also from China. She never liked Earl Grey tea. It was…too sour for her,” Charlotte spoke softly, as gentle as the cat.</p>
	<p>Then she suddenly gasped for air as though she was drowning in tears, her fingers clutching so tightly on the cracks that crumbles of clay fell onto the table.</p>
	<p>“She would’ve been the same age as you. A beautiful grown-up lady.”</p>
	<p>Lin reached for Charlotte’s hand and said, “I’m very sorry.”</p>
	<p>The cat walked to Charlotte, licking at her slippers.</p>
	<p>Charlotte shook her head.</p>
	<p>“Lily was canoeing with my ex-husband,” she said, choking, “I wasn’t with her. I couldn’t save her.”</p>
	<p>Lin watched a gust of wind blowing off the last leaf on the maple tree in front of Charlotte’s house, hoping that somehow she could become Lily.</p>
	<p>Both Charlotte and Lin said nothing for a long time. The cat jumped onto Charlotte’s lap, squinting its eyes, ready for another nap.</p>
	<p>Charlotte stopped sobbing and took out a jade bracelet from her pocket.</p>
	<p>“It’s Lily’s favorite,” she said. “Lily thought it had an oriental look. She always wanted to visit China someday.”</p>
	<p>Charlotte slipped the bracelet onto Lin’s wrist, smiling like a mother.</p>
	<p>“Happy birthday,” Charlotte said.</p>
	<p>Lin got up from her chair and hugged Charlotte, the way a child hugs her mother when she comes home from a long and weary trip, her face touching Charlotte’s soft hair, a field of golden canola blooms.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>It was a family joke how bad a swimmer Lin was. She and Mei used to train together every weekend in a river near their middle school. The coach would keep their heads under water for minutes so they could learn to hold their breaths longer. “A couple minutes may save you from drowning,” he told them.</p>
	<p>Lin swore that she would not go back to that river since she left middle school, but the river did teach her something about not getting drowned.</p>
	<p class="center"><em>*</em></p>
	<p>The day before winter break, Lin stopped Nate in the hallway.</p>
	<p>“I was rude to you,” she said. “I apologize.”</p>
	<p>She hadn’t talked to Nate since their conversation in the dining hall three months ago. She thought she’d never talk to him again, but she changed her mind.</p>
	<p>Nate turned around to face her, blushing and looking her in the eyes for the first time. A faint smile came across the corners of his mouth.</p>
	<p>“Will you forgive me now?” he asked.</p>
	<p>She nodded her head.</p>
	<p>“Did you tell Charlotte everything?” he whispered, chuckling embarrassingly.</p>
	<p>She hesitated a little and nodded once more.</p>
	<p>“Everyone hopes she’s his mother,” he said. “She even manages to put up with me, a frat boy with obsessive-compulsive disorder.”</p>
	<p>Nate straightened the edge of his shirt.</p>
	<p>“Are you two also friends?” Lin asked.</p>
	<p>The hallway was packed with students walking from class to class. Several people were glancing over at them, but Lin didn’t mind.</p>
	<p>Nate scratched his head and said, “She’s a family friend. She’s known me since I was nine when Michael went here. It’s a shame that she’s leaving the school after this semester.”</p>
	<p>“What?” </p>
	<p>Lin couldn’t believe her ears.</p>
	<p>Nate blushed again and bit his lips.</p>
	<p>“I thought you knew,” he said. “She resigned…because of family issues.”</p>
	<p>Lin gazed across the quad at Tisch Hall. </p>
	<p>“I need to say goodbye to her,” she said to Nate.</p>
	<p>Lin dashed out and caught Charlotte as she was leaving the building.</p>
	<p>They didn’t say anything, but a spring of water surged from Lin’s eyes. The water was cool and tranquil, flickering under the setting sun. It didn’t want to bend a tree or crush a stone; it just wanted to go forward, forward to the verge of the horizon.</p>
	<p>I’m going home, Lin thought, just before the canola flowers bloom.</p>
